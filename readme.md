To see the result on [GithubPage](https://nadtr.github.io/js-web-2.1/)



## The exercise:  **Improved Cat cycler**

Display cat images use the [random.cat API](https://aws.random.cat/meow) in your app one by one by cycling automatically every second.

These images must be *displayed in a 500x500 pixel square* and should be *resized and cropped automatically* to fit in this space regardless of their original resolution or aspect-ratio.
